## Troubleshooting

Sometimes there is an error of the type:

	Cannot access folder: '/camp/stp/babs/working/<USER>/.../work/f8/810a2...'

I absolutely don't know why this happens. I just need to run nextflow again with the `-resume` option and everything is fine, so I suspect a connection problem.
I do not have this kind of error with snakemake though.
Need to find out what's happening.
